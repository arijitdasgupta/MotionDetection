Motion detection with OpenCV + Python
-------------------------------------

This starts as a B. Tech final year project in object tracking. Most internet references I got my hands on was based on color based object tracking. I decided to make a general motion tracking system.

I tried using Optical Flow calculation methods that comes with OpenCV, but I found them not easy to use, so I decided to make my own rudimentary motion tracking system.
I plan to extend the whole program, for now it can detect stuff moving left or right with a webcam and prints the direction out.

To run the program you would need OpenCV 2.2 installed with Python 2.7
